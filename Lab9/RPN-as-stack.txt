The RPN code uses a stack to store and evaluate a given stream of input.
As RPN is evaluated from left to right, it can use the stack structure
to push and pop data accordingly to evaluate the complete stack.
For example, if we have:
5 3 +

The RPN calculator would do the following operations:

Push 5 to stack
Push 3 to stack
Pop two operands from stack, evaluate, push result to stack
result.

It lets the calculator evaluate the entire stack by evaluating
two at a time and then pushing back to the stack until there is nothing
left the stack is left with the result.
