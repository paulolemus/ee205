 How are primitive data types stored in memory?

 We can look to the memory address of a primitive type and see how it is stored.

 int:
These would be stored as bits in memory. On my computer an int is 32 bits.
The int -1 on my computer was shown as FFFFFFFF, or 11111111....(x32).

 char:
Char takes 8 bits, or a byte. The char 'a' was represented by 0x61,
which is also the ASCII hex code for 'a'.

 float:
floats are saved in the IEEE 754 single precision floating point format.
On my device I believe it takes 32 bits, and has the following format:
sign x 1, exponent x 8, fraction x 23

 double:
doubles are floats but in the double precision format.
sign 1x, exponent 11x, fraction 52x.

 //////////////////
 The first element of an array is the "head" of the array. By moving up the 
 same number of bytes as the size of the type of array, we can find the next element.
