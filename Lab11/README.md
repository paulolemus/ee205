# EE 205 Lab 11

To make any of the tests, you must have googletest installed.

I wrote two main classes, BinaryTree in BinaryTree.h and the BinaryTree in UnsortedBTree.h
The one in BinaryTree.h is a standard binary tree that has several recursive functions,
The one in UnsortedBTree.h has a structure than more closely follows the guidelines given in
the lab assignment.
